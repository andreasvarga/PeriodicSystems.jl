# Conversions to LTI representations

* **[`psaverage`](@ref)**  Computation of the averaged LTI system of a continuous-time periodic system.
* **[`psteval`](@ref)**  Computation of the time evaluated LTI system of a continuous-time periodic system.
* **[`ps2fls`](@ref)**  Computation of a complex frequency-lifted LTI representation of a continuous-time periodic system. 
* **[`ps2frls`](@ref)**  Computation of a real frequency-lifted LTI representation of a continuous-time periodic system. 
* **[`ps2ls`](@ref)**  Computation of a time-lifted LTI representation of a discrete-time periodic system. 
* **[`ps2spls`](@ref)**  Computation of a sparse time-lifted LTI representation of a discrete-time periodic system.
