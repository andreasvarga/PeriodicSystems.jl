# Release Notes


## Version 0.1.0

This is the initial release providing prototype implementations of several periodic array objects 
which served for the definition of the basic continuous-time and discrete-time periodic system objects. Several basic computational functions as the periodic Schur form, eigenvalues of matrix products, computation of monodromy matrix and computation of characteristic exponents/multipliers have been implemented. Two conversion functions of continuous-time periodic models (discretization, averaging) and a function for discretization/resampling of multirate LTI models have been implemented.
