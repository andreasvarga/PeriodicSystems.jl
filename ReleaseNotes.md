# Release Notes

## Version 0.4 (WIP)

This minor version includes several new functions for the solution of discrete-time periodic Lyapunov equations and implements basic operations with discrete-time periodic matrices. 

## Version 0.3.1

This patch version relies on a new wrapper for the SLICOT subroutine MB03VW available in release v5.8 and includes several new functions for the computation of periodic Hessenberg and Schur decompositions. 

## Version 0.3 

This minor version includes new functions for the computation of poles and zeros of periodic systems. 

## Version 0.2

This minor release includes new functions for the computation of characteristic exponents of continuous-time periodic state matrices using frequency-lifting based on Harmonic Array and Fourier Function Matrix representations. 
For continuous-time periodic systems two functions have been implemented to build truncated 
Toeplitz operators based frequency lifted LTI systems (complex and real). 
For discrete-time periodic systems a function has been implemented to build several types of lifted LTI representations.


## Version 0.1.0

This is the initial release providing prototype implementations of several periodic array objects 
which served for the definition of the basic continuous-time and discrete-time periodic system objects. Several basic computational functions as the periodic Schur form, eigenvalues of matrix products, computation of monodromy matrix and computation of characteristic exponents/multipliers have been implemented. Two conversion functions of continuous-time periodic models (discretization, averaging) and a function for discretization/resampling of multirate LTI models have been implemented.
