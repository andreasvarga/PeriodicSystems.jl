# Release Notes


## Version 0.1.0

This is the initial release providing prototype implementations of several periodic array objects to serve for the definition of the basic continuous-time and discrete-time periodic system objects. Several basic computational functions as the periodic Schur form, eigenvalues of matrix products, computation of monodromy matrix and computation of characteristic exponents (also known as characteristic multipliers) have been implemented.
